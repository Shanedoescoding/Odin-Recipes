# Odin-Recipes
My first website project!!!!
This is my first project using HTML. I love the Odin Project and how helpful it has proven to be thusfar. This particular website is over recipes. By the end of this project I will be able to display my profficiency in HTML through the use of a basic boiler plate. I will display headings, lists, images and links.
